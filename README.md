## Contributors

* Most of the knowledge thus far of using React has come from Wes Bos React tutorial. So shout out to Wes Bos!

## Observations
* It has been a obstacle hurdling experience.  I have found React to be fairly intuitive for being such a beginner. However, I did come across some hang ups getting my answers to generate. I believe I needed to pass the props down the children. I will continue working on it through out the weekend.
